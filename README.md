# longest_subseq
initial task is
![](https://github.com/melik-a/longest_non_increasing_subseq/blob/master/task.png)

solution of initial task is to find in a sequence Longest Continuous Non-Increasing Subsequence.
programm includes function to find:
  - Longest Continuous Non-Increasing Subsequence.
  - Longest Continuous Increasing Subsequence.

[Additional tasks]
the programm also finds in a sequence:
  - Longest Non-Increasing Subsequence(LNIS).
  - Longest Non-Decreasing Subsequence(LNDS).
  - Longest Increasing Subsequence(LIS).
  - Longest Decreasing Subsequence(LDS).

to find subsequences are used different algorithms.
